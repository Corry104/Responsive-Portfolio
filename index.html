                Hey welcome to my homepage, my name is Corrado. I am 32 years old, from Rome, Italy. 
                <br><br> The guy you see next to me in the picture is Tristan, my son.
                Tristan and I have a lot in common, we like outdoors sports, travelling, love the ocean, riding bikes and playing soccer. Our favourite team is Lazio! 
                <br><br>
                ..... oh and almost forgot we love travelling around California looking for renaissance fairs... we kill it!!
                <br><br>
                I grew up in two major cities, Rome and London. Lived in Paris for a while and now I call myself an Angeleno. <br>
                <br> I am very very very new in the computer science industry and i really like it. Anyway  this is my first real project, a web page about myself.
                Why don't you check it out and tell me what you think. In the contact tab there is a form, feel free to shoot some feedback there!!
                <br><br><br>
                Thanks for visiting!!!
